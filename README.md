## Project Overview
This repository contains the submission for the [thirdhomework](https://github.com/Sapienza-University-Rome/ADM/tree/master/2024/Homework_3) of the [ADM course](http://aris.me/contents/teaching/data-mining-ds-2024). 

### Search Engine
The main project implements a search engine for [Michelin-starred restaurants in Italy](https://guide.michelin.com/en/it/restaurants). The objective is to design and develop both conjunctive and ranked search engines, enabling users to search for specific restaurants based on their preferences. This search engine leverages TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to process and rank search results, allowing efficient data retrieval and accurate ranking.

### Algorithim Question
