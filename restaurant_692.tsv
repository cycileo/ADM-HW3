Buca di Sant'Antonio	via della Cervia 3	Lucca	55100	Italy	€€	Tuscan, Classic Cuisine	Just a stone’s throw from Piazza San Michele, in the heart of the beautiful historic centre of Lucca, the Buca di Sant'Antonio dates back over 200 years and is one of the city’s oldest restaurants. Here, the old copper pots and pans that hang from the ceiling add to the warm, romantic atmosphere, while the cuisine unsurprisingly showcases traditional Tuscan specialities including meat dishes and home-made pasta.
