Foresta	strada de la Comunità de Fiem 42	Moena	38035	Italy	€€	Regional Cuisine, Classic Cuisine	Situated in front of a dense fir wood, this restaurant comes as something of a surprise. The dishes are prepared with genuine local ingredients, resulting in food that is full of flavour. Don’t get up from the table without having tasted the pappardelle pasta with mushrooms and speck ham or the fillet of venison with a redcurrant sauce.
