Taverna 58	corso Manthoné 46	Pescara	65127	Italy	€	Cuisine from Abruzzo, Traditional Cuisine	Situated in the district where Ennio Flaiano and Gabriele d'Annunzio once lived, this excellent trattoria has been in business now for over 40 years. Despite changing hands in 2020, the restaurant’s essence remains the same. The cuisine is still simple and rustic, generously portioned and full of flavour, with its roots firmly planted in Abruzzi traditions. The menu features arrosticini (skewered grilled meat), vegetable and goat’s cheese fritters, numerous meat-based main courses (mutton, pork, rabbit, wild boar, veal, beef etc), and a white Abruzzese torrone named Oh pe' la Maiellaby the restaurant. Guests are welcome to visit the medieval and Roman remains in the wine cellars.
