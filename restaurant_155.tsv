Pashà	via Morgantini 2	Conversano	70014	Italy	€€€€	Apulian, Modern Cuisine	This restaurant housed in the immense and historic Palazzo del Seminario Vescovile (Bishop’s Seminary) boasts a plain yet elegant interior decor, outstanding service and reinterpreted regional cuisine, all of which contribute to a very pleasant dining experience. The cuisine focuses on the region, with the occasional influence from Sicily, the chef’s homeland. Highlights on the menu include caviar and caprese (Altamura buffalo mozzarella with beluga caviar and a cherry tomato salad), and lamb with shallots in which the full flavours and tender textures of the meat shine through. As there’s only one tasting menu, remember to mention any food intolerances or preferences when you book. And when it comes to choosing your wine, make sure you ask talented sommelier Juan Pablo for recommendations – he will delight in taking you on a world tour which includes some really interesting labels!
