Osteria Le Panzanelle	località Lucarelli 29	Lucarelli	53017	Italy	€€	Tuscan	This pleasant rural trattoria has a simple, informal ambience, plus an attractive outdoor space in the shady garden. Wherever you sit, you’ll savour generous portions of delicious regional cuisine, including home-made pasta and excellent meat – we particularly enjoyed the pici pasta with garlic and the rabbit stuffed with spinach. Fresh fish from the island of Elba is served on Fridays, while the wine list focuses on Tuscan labels. It’s always a good idea to book ahead!
