Serendepico	via della Chiesa di Gragnano 36	Capannori	55012	Italy	€€	Fusion, Japanese	An entertaining culinary experience, thanks to the Japanese chef who serves his own “fusion” cuisine influenced by Italian dishes (and occasionally European, such as the Basque cheesecake) with the occasional Japanese twist. On Thursdays, the menu is completely Japanese with a focus on typical specialities such as sushi, sashimi, tempura and gyoza dishes.
