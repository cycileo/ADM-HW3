Muraglia - Conchiglia d'Oro	via Aurelia 133	Varigotti	17024	Italy	€€€	Seafood, Classic Cuisine	Here, choose between the simply furnished, bright dining room with a proudly vintage feel that dates back to its opening in the 1970s and a tiny yet attractive terrace with sea views (there are just a few tables, so it’s best to book in advance). Fish has always been – and still is – the house speciality, with fresh, top-quality dishes simply prepared according to classic methods such as the barbecue grill visible in the dining room. The fish is so fresh that the handwritten menu changes daily.	['Terrace']	['amex', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 019 698015
